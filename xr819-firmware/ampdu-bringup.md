# TX A-MPDU bring-up

## Qualified prerequisites

The ordinary host-TX scheduler can publish two non-aggregate frames through one
trigger/GO transaction. A diagnostic build measured 859 depth-two batches in a
10-second TCP run, but throughput remained near 2 Mbit/s. Multi-slot publication
alone is therefore not the vendor performance mechanism.

The aggregation grouping gate now uses typed PAS fields and requires:

- QoS data frames;
- the same interface, internal link, TID, and rate;
- an HT rate;
- an enabled host BlockAck policy; and
- a TX BlockAck session reported operational by the host.

A diagnostic run measured 777 eligible depth-two pairs in 10 seconds at TID 0
and rate index 19. Candidate supply is not the limiting factor.

The vendor `txp_desc_emit` opcode stream and its eight-by-eight negotiated
spacing/rate table are translated by the depth-two descriptor builder. Aggregate
length includes delimiter alignment, spacing bytes, the second MPDU, and FCS
allowance.

## BlockAck negotiation

The upstream-style cw1200 path assumed firmware-owned negotiation. It set
`TX_AMPDU_SETUP_IN_HW`, rejected every `ampdu_action`, and dropped all BlockAck
category action frames in `cw1200_tx_h_action()`.

The open-firmware path instead delegates negotiation to mac80211:

1. BlockAck action frames pass through normal WSM TX.
2. `IEEE80211_AMPDU_TX_START` returns immediate acceptance.
3. Operational and stopped TIDs are reported through private MIB `0xff48`.
4. Firmware does not admit an aggregate before the operational notification.

Monitor capture confirmed successful ADDBA exchange and the
`IEEE80211_AMPDU_TX_OPERATIONAL` callback. With aggregation still disabled, the
qualified WPA2 HT image sustained 3.95 Mbit/s TCP, 20/20 ping, an idle BH/WSM,
and zero used buffers. This is a useful prerequisite independently of the
kind-1 descriptor work.

## Rejected kind-1 experiment

A feature-gated depth-two experiment folded two reversible scheduler
reservations into one kind-1 pipe slot, used the typed software-record free
list, linked PAS `dwNextInAmpdu`, and emitted one command stream.

Every tested version stalled at the first aggregate after roughly 47-71 KiB of
ordinary traffic. Symptoms were consistent:

- no aggregate appeared in monitor capture;
- 10-14 host buffers remained owned;
- the BH stayed alive initially, then reported missed interrupts / TX-confirm
  timeout;
- no hardware `AGG TXed` or `MULTI TXed` accounting appeared.

The following corrections did not make the descriptor start:

- replacing ordinary batch bits 26/27 with aggregate member/head flags
  `0x20`/`0x40`;
- including negotiated spacing bytes in aggregate length;
- preparing each member's `dwParentQ` descriptor and invoking it from word 2;
- reproducing the vendor special-ACK branch (`slot+0xd = 0x0c`, `slot+0xe = 1`,
  and the additional duration/flags).

The failed hardware-publication code was removed rather than committed. Do not
re-enable kind-1 publication until the remaining pre-GO slot/command state is
compared against a live vendor aggregate. The stable production image keeps the
negotiation and typed descriptor prerequisites only.
